 Task 2: 
Choose one game you have played and write:
What the player does most of the time
What challenges the game gives
What rewards keep the player playing
One thing you would improve and why.

So I choose Red Dead Redemption 2. Most of the time, the player is riding horses, travelling across the map, and exploring the game’s very realistic environment. You also spend a lot of time hunting, interacting with characters, and experiencing the world at your own pace. One of the main challenges in the game is dealing with bounty hunters and lawmen who are always hunting you, which makes every action feel risky. The reward in this game isn’t level-ups or competitive rankings like in multiplayer games, but the relaxation and satisfaction that comes from the story, the atmosphere, and how immersive everything feels. I honestly wouldn’t improve much because the game already feels perfect, but if I had to change one thing, I would let Arthur kill Micah before he dies, since that would feel more satisfying and give better closure to the story..
